# Stable-Yield-Aggregator

 
Stable Yield Aggregator is an open-source smart contract project that demonstrates the core functionality of a decentralized yield aggregator. Built in Solidity using Foundry, the contract allows users to deposit stablecoins (such as DAI or USDC) and later withdraw them, setting the stage for future integration with yield-generating protocols like Aave or Compound. This repository contains the basic contract implementation along with unit tests that verify deposit and withdrawal functionality. It serves as the foundational module in our  vision of our bigger plan for AI-driven DeFi. 

We will include smart contracts and stablecoin deposits and withdrawl features here. Code here are written by me first hand. 
This project is still ongoing! Contributions and feedback are welcome! and STAY TUNED for more to come!
